# dotfiles #

My treasure trove of configuration files. I'm still working out just how much I can share between Mac OS X and Gentoo Linux.

## Todo ##
 * decide on how to install / update dotfiles
 * write a script to do that

## Install script brainstorming ##
Since it's too late to do it tonight:
 * make a list of dotfiles in the repo
 * prepend entries with dots (maybe at same time as above)
 * make gzipped tar archive of those files in ~
 * move the files in repo to ~
 * done?
